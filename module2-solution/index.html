		Illumina's 1.7 run starts off as a typical run, however he does not find a temple and therefore relies on leaves to set up his tower. His spawns are remarkably good as well as the drop rate. He leaves the tower at insane pace, and unbeknownst to Illumina, the stronghold was right under his tower. Had he somehow known this, many argue that this run would have been under 20 minutes, however that would require an astoundingly fast end fight. Overall the run is very clean.</p>

		Couriway's seed provides the necessary and classic structures needed for a 1.14 run, however they are all spread out. His temple and shipwreck loot lets him get an edge during the trading segment, which lasts a lightning-fast 4 minutes. This is because of the excess gold and emeralds which lets him get more pearls for less tnt usage. He finds the stronghold quickly because of its proximity, and the rest of the run is clean.</p>

		The village near spawn provides Couriway with some obsidian, and a close by lava pool grants fast access to the nether. Using the new bastion strats, he is able to get a bucketload of pearls in a short time and pearls to a nearby fortress. After getting blaze rods, he makes a second nether portal to exit, and enters the stronghold which is very close-by because of the nether-travel. The rest of the run is well executed.</p>
